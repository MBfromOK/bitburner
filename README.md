##My collection of bitburner Scripts


**Note:** Not all this code is my own, I try to give credit where credit is due.

For Example:
Casually Silent aka chrisrabe produced the multi-threaded and Pirate themed: Flog, Nourish, & Plunder Scripts that I may / may not have modified:

  + aps-lite.js
  + find-targets.js
  + launch-Fleets.js
  + pirate.js
  + utils.js
  + watchtower.js
